# üìå Project Setup Guide

Portfolio Management Dashboard is a full-stack web application that helps users efficiently manage and track their investment portfolio. It provides an intuitive interface for monitoring assets, analyzing performance, and managing subscriptions with real-time backend integration.

## üèó Architecture Overview

The **Portfolio Management Dashboard** follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript):** Provides the user interface, handles routing, and communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript):** Handles business logic, authentication, and API requests. It exposes secure endpoints for the frontend.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores user information, portfolio data, transactions, and other business entities. The backend communicates with the database using Sequelize ORM.
- **Communication:** The frontend interacts with the backend over HTTP (using Axios/Fetch), while authentication and authorization are managed using JWT tokens pr cookies.
